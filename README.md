# Transformer Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Transformer architecture, its core components, and the general approach to implementing it.

## What is a Transformer, fundamentally?

At its core, a Transformer is a neural network architecture designed to process sequential data, most famously text. Its main innovation, introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need," is the **self-attention mechanism**.

Before Transformers, models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) processed sequences word by word, which made it difficult to capture long-range dependencies and was slow due to its sequential nature.

The Transformer, on the other hand, can process all the words in a sequence simultaneously. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of every other word in the sequence when processing a single word, giving it a much better understanding of the context.

## What are the main components of a Transformer?

A standard Transformer is composed of two main parts: an **Encoder** and a **Decoder**.

### 1. Input Embedding and Positional Encoding

*   **Input Embedding:** The input sequence (e.g., a sentence) is first converted into a sequence of numerical vectors, or "embeddings."
*   **Positional Encoding:** Since the model processes all words at once, it has no inherent sense of word order. Positional encodings are added to the embeddings to give the model information about the position of each word in the sequence.

### 2. The Encoder

The encoder's job is to read the input sequence and generate a rich contextual representation of it. It consists of a stack of identical layers. Each encoder layer has two main sub-layers:

*   **Multi-Head Self-Attention:** This is the core of the Transformer. It allows each word to "look" at all the other words in the input sequence and decide which ones are most important for understanding its own meaning.
*   **Feed-Forward Neural Network:** A simple, fully connected neural network that processes the output of the attention layer.

Each of these sub-layers is followed by a residual connection and layer normalization.

### 3. The Decoder

The decoder's job is to take the encoder's output and generate the output sequence (e.g., the translated sentence). It also consists of a stack of identical layers. Each decoder layer has three main sub-layers:

*   **Masked Multi-Head Self-Attention:** Similar to the encoder's self-attention, but it's "masked" to prevent the model from looking at future words in the output sequence during training.
*   **Encoder-Decoder Attention:** This is where the decoder pays attention to the output of the encoder, allowing it to draw context from the input sequence.
*   **Feed-Forward Neural Network:** Same as in the encoder.

These sub-layers also have residual connections and layer normalization.

### 4. Final Output Layer

The output of the decoder is passed through a final linear layer and a softmax function to produce a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary for the next word in the sequence.

## What is the implementation technique?

The implementation of a Transformer generally follows these steps:

1.  **Build the Building Blocks:** You start by implementing the fundamental components:
    *   The **Multi-Head Self-Attention** layer.
    *   The **Feed-Forward Neural Network**.
    *   The **Positional Encoding** logic.

2.  **Create the Encoder and Decoder Layers:**
    *   You combine the self-attention layer and the feed-forward network to create a single **Encoder Layer**. In the `RLT_.ipynb` file, the `TransformerBlock` class is an implementation of an encoder layer.
    *   You create a **Decoder Layer** by combining the masked self-attention, encoder-decoder attention, and feed-forward network.

3.  **Stack the Layers:**
    *   You create the full **Encoder** by stacking multiple encoder layers on top of each other.
    *   You create the full **Decoder** by stacking multiple decoder layers.

4.  **Create the Transformer Model:**
    *   You combine the encoder and decoder into a single `Transformer` model that takes the input and output sequences and passes them through the encoder and decoder, respectively.

5.  **Training:**
    *   You train the model by feeding it pairs of input and output sequences and using a loss function (like cross-entropy) to adjust the model's weights.

The code in this repository provides a practical example of how to implement a Transformer-based model.
